# Information and Coding Theory Course Project

## General Description
This is the Github repository of the project of the course Information and Coding Theory in Skoltech 2021(by Prof.Alexey Frolov).
The project is about Cooperative learning of encoding/decoding functions.

## How to reproduce results?
1. Run `bpsk_awgn.m` in Matlab $\rightarrow$ the theoretical value and simulation of BPSK-AWGN channel without coding.
2. Text `bertool` in Matlab and run `BER Comparison.ber` in bertool $\rightarrow$ BER Comparison of Different Error Correcting Codes(figure 4 in the report).
3. Run `Polar.ipynb` by Jupyter Notebook $\rightarrow$ the comparison between Polar Code with given parameters and theoretical BER of the channel.
4. The implementation of our NN can be found in the file folder `Neural Network Implementation`.
